        <h2>Connect</h2>
        <p>
            Connect with local musicians or across the country, it's up to you.  Musicians are no longer bound to those close to you to collaborate.  Make friend, share ideas,  and make music together.  For generations music has brought people together. [roc]book makes sure to follow in that tradition.
