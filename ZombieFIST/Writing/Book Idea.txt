20 years in the future people have halolenz technology built into their eyes with wireless transievers.  They live in a truly digital world where to live and work and buy groceries you have to have the tech installed to see prices etc.

A man loses his wife in a horrific accident, in her will she specifies to build a AI to live and act as her to help her husband cope with the loss.  She talks to him, she does dishes, watches TV endlessly talking to him.  And he barely says anything to her. He meets a women and the reader believes that he is falling for another women but in reality his wife is already dead, but he hasn't been able to cope and move on because her AI is still in the vitual world, which is visually impossible to tell the difference. Except that halograms are in fact hollow.  But the reader doesn't find out unil later that his wife is actually gone. His best friend knows that he cant let her go and that he should, but whenever he stops by he completely ignores her, he looks at her and shakes his head in disbelief. I want the reader to feel sorry for the wife but also feel sorry for him so that if he meets another woman they almost want him to leave her. I will drop subtle clues that she isn't really there but not enough to give it away to the reader, very tricky and challenging to do but I would love to write this book.  Maybe a novella length, maybe push 40k words im visioning.  It will have to be character driven vs plot driven. It will also half to be fairly dark in nature.  Not some futuristic Nicholas Sparks novel(puke)
