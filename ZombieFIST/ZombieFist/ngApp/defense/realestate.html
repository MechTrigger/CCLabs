                    <h5>Choosing the right fortification might be the most important descision you'll have to make.  Helping you decide the good from the bad, we are here is a list of tips to help you.</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>choose a building with few windows, reasons obvious</li>
                        <li>you can't beat concrete or brick structures</li>
                        <li>don't pick something too big to manage with your party</li>
                        <li>roof should have a flat surface so you can scout and snipe without bringing notice to yourself during daylight hours</li>
                        <li>don't go to the mall, you've seen Dawn of the Dead</li>
                        <li>don't stay in your house, you've seen Dawn of the Dead</li>
                        <li>don't stay anywhere that the leader calls himself the Governor, you've seen the Walking Dead.</li>
                        <li>location must be near fresh water source or you'll die anyway</li>
                        <li>don't bunker down in large cities you'll die</li>
                        <li>don't bunker down in small towns you'll live longer but still die</li>
                        <li>don't bunker down, you have to move eventually but probably die anyway</li>
                        <li>if you have enough food and water for a few months stay and gather resources and play the waiting game, maybe the plague will pass</li>
                        <li>height is your friend, choose a structure with at least two stories</li>
                        <li>block all light pollution at night, you don't want to be a beacon for night stalkers(zombies and other people)</li>
                        <li>if grandma Edna refuses to leave her house because all of her memories of grandpa George are there, leave her behind, shes had a long life already anyway, move to a more secure location, you can bring a picture if you want.</li>
                        <li>use your best judgement, if it was designed to keep people in or out it is probably a good choice</li>
