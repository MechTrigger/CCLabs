                        Tools we consider anything you would find in a garage. Shovels, axes, hell, even a 2x4 could serve a purpose for defense.  While we don't suggest using an axe for your primary weapon slot it can be utilized in many a situation.

                        Have you ever swung an axe and missed your target.  The momentum alone will drop you on your keister and help you aquire a brand new munched out blood squirting hole in your trapizius. Axes are good for chopping wood, and rakes are good for leaves.  You don't really have a rake do you?  You are probably too dead to read this.
