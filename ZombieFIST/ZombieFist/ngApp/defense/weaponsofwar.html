                    <h3>Weapons of war</h3>
                    <h5>Weapon choice for building defense is dramtically more verstile than if you are trekking across zombieland.  When weight isn't a factor you can afford to have tremendous variety. While we don't recommend playing a head blasting mash of celebrity look-a-likes meets where's waldo, you should have weapons to poke things at tremendous distance. It may just help keep the other most prevalent enemy at bay, other people. </h5>
                    <ul>
                        Top Ten Weapons and Why:
                        <li>9mm/40cal Pistol - Most readily available ammunition.</li>
                        <li>12ga Shotgun - The most versatile weapon in your arsenal.</li>
                        <li>Bolt Action Rifle - For poking things from a distance.</li>
                        <li>Compound Bow - It pays to be quiet...shhhhhh...</li>
                        <li>Machete - For reasons other than splitting skulls, but that's cool too.</li>
                        <li>.50 Desert Eagle - Intimidation and the potential to use Bulletooth Tony lines all day.</li>
                        <li>AK47 - Reliability. Bury it for 5 years, dig it up, and it still shoots. Awesome.</li>
                        <li>Flamethrower - You honestly think you would find one? Still, it'd be awesome.</li>
                        <li>A1 Abrahams - Ha! Let's hope there is an instruction manual. Hella awesome.</li>
                        <li>Your Mind - "C'mon stop trying to hit me and hit me!" It will save you, for awhile.</li>
