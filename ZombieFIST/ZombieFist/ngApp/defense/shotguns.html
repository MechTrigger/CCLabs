                        What could be more fun than peppering baddies with buckshot? Shotguns can get you more bang for your buck and probably the most readily available ammunition accross the nation.  Ready and able to perform meat chunking in close quarters and providing hunting capability necessary for long term survival.  Keep it simple with this baby, you don't need anything fancy just make sure you have a slug barrel for zombie head casturation and a bird barrel for hunting water fowl and small game.

                    <p>
                        While versitility is the key factor in choosing this weapon. There are some cons to consider.  It isnt nearly as accurate as a rifle, along with being long and clunky in tight quarters. Keep this baby clean too, jamming can be an issue with many a blunderbuss.
