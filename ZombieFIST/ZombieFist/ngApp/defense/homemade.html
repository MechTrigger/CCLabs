                        There are many weapons that can be fashioned from common materials you can scavange.  Probably our personal favorite would be 'the potato shooter'.  I know what you are thinking.  Did they just recommend a potato shooter?  Well, they are easy to make: PVC, glue, a grill ignitor and cheap hairspray. They actually pack a wholloping punch, and with a little imagination you can think of all sorts of violent projectiles.

                    <!-- Cons -->

                        Homemade weapons are generally less reliable and more novelty than anything else.  While a potato shooter would be fun, I really don't think any of us are Mygyver material. So probably leave the potato shooters generation-Z teenagers.
