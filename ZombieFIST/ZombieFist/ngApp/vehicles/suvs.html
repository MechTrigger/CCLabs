                        Some SUV's have great suspension and most have unexposed storage area.  If you choose a solid model, you can expect a versatile vehicle that responds well in both rough terrain and navigating city streets.  There won't be shortage of these anytime soon.  Every soccer mom in our country is bound to own one of these at some point.  Opt for the more rugged jeep variety.

                    <!-- Cons -->
                    <p>
                        If you count the cost there isn't much that a decent SUV gives up that it doesn't giveback something valuable in return.
