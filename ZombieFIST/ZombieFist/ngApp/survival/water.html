                        Water is the most important factor when it comes to long term suvival.  Always know where you are and where the water is.  Don't know how to read a map? You better learn because GPS probably won't work.  You should have plenty of water purification tabs, kits, and worse case a pot to boil the water first.  I wouldn't trust any source that isn't in a sealed bottle. You never know what kind of posse is lurking in there waiting to go all medival on your system.  It's water. You need it. Find it. Drink it.
