                        This could mean the difference between a chance at survival and a quick death.
                        The benefit of having just even the bare essentials cannot be overstated.
                        The critical factor of surviving the first few weeks is going to be location.
                        The majority of US population, 80.7 percent, lives in urban areas.
                        What does this mean? It means not only are you going to have to fight zombies,
                        but an even more dangerous animal, frightened people.  When the entire populations
                        survival instincts kick in, people do crazy s%!@. Therefore you will increase you
                        chance of survival significantly if you don't have to run to Wal-Mart after society
                        starts to collapse. Even if you survive you trip, you've wasted critical time and
                        the roads will become jammed and impassable.  Now you are stuck on foot, with a
                        bunch of gear that most people don't have and even if you have a gun, which you
                        better at this point, a mob may over take you and strip you of everything and back
                        to square one you go.
